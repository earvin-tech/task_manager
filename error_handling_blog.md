# <p style="text-align: center">⚠️ Centralised Error Handling in Express.js: Why It Matters and How to Build It</p>

We as developers all know how important error handling is to our projects — it allows for the smooth operation of our code. Catching and handling errors ensures our applications can run without crashing due to both client-side and server-side issues.

When building an Express.js API, it can be tempting to haphazardly add try/catch blocks all over your routes. But as your codebase grows, this approach becomes very unorganised and difficult to track or maintain.

That’s where centralised error handling becomes useful.

With centralised error handling, we have one orderly place to manage errors across the entire application. It ensures consistency in responses, making debugging later on much simpler — both in development and in production.

This post will explain the importance of centralised error handling and how to implement it in an Express.js project. The demonstration will be based on a project example: the Task Manager API developed by Earvin Tumpao.

## ❌ The Problem With Scattered Try/Catch Blocks

At first, it might seem convenient to wrap all your Express route handlers in `try/catch` blocks. But doing this for every controller bloats your codebase, breaks DRY principles, and leads to repetitive logic instead of reusable patterns.

A problem with consistency also arises — some controllers might send different types of error messages: some custom, some generic, and some even exposing stack traces.

Even worse, important details like setting the right status code, logging the error, or hiding sensitive information in production can be easily forgotten or handled inconsistently.

Here’s a typical example of a controller without centralised handling:

```js
const getUser = async (request, response) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(request.params.id);
    if (!user) return response.status(404).json({ message: "User not found" });

    response.json(user);
  } catch (err) {
    response.status(500).json({ message: err.message });
  }
};
```
>It works — but imagine repeating that pattern in every controller.

## 🧩 What is Centralised Error Handling?

Centralised error handling is the practice of managing all application errors in a single place — typically through a custom middleware function in Express.

Rather than writing multiple `try/catch` blocks and sending error responses in every controller, you can forward errors using `next(err)` and let the centralised error handler take care of it.

This results in cleaner controllers that stay focused on business logic, while a single error handler is responsible for formatting the error response, setting the appropriate status code, and managing stack trace output in production.

## 🛠️ How to Build It in Express.js

Now that we understand why d error handling matters, let’s walk through how to implement it step-by-step in Express.

It only takes two steps:

1. Create the error handler middleware
2. Plug it into your Express applications — after all other routes

---

### 1️⃣ Create the Middleware

Inside `src/middleware/errorHandler.js`:

```js
const errorHandler = (err, request, response, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack); // Optional: send to external logging service

  const statusCode = response.statusCode !== 200 ? response.statusCode : 500;

  response.status(statusCode).json({
    message: err.message || "Internal Server Error",
    stack: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "💥" : err.stack,
  });
};

module.exports = errorHandler;
```
✅ This function:
- Logs the error
- Sets a safe fallback status code (`500`)
- Sends back a clear message and stack trace (hidden in production)

### 2️⃣ Register the Middleware

In your `server.js` register the error handler **after all your routes**:

```js
const errorHandler = require("./middleware/errorHandler");

// Route definitions above...
app.use("/api/users", userRoutes);
app.use("/api/projects", projectRoutes);
app.use("/api/tasks", taskRoutes);

// Error handler comes last
app.use(errorHandler);
```
It's important to make sure the error handler is last, as the other routes will pass on any uncaught errors to the error handler.

---

## 🧪 Putting It into Practice

In the Task Manager API project, each controller uses `try/catch`blocks to handle asynchronous logic — but instead of sending error responses directly from these controllers, they are forwarded to the centralised error handler using `next(err)`.

Here's an example from the UserController — the registerUser function:

```js
const registerUser = async (request, response, next) => {
  try {
    const { username, email, password } = request.body;

    const existingUser = await User.findOne({ $or: [{ username }, { email }] });
    if (existingUser) {
      response.status(400);
      return next(new Error("Username or email already exists"));
    }

    // Save logic...
    const newUser = new User({ username, email, password });
    await newUser.save();

    response.status(201).json({ message: "User created successfully" });
  } catch (err) {
    next(err); // Send to centralised error handler
  }
};
```
✅ Instead of sending a custom error response here, we delegate that responsibility to the centralised middleware.

This keeps controller code focused on its core logic — and every error flows through a single place, no matter what route or controller it comes from.

## 🧼 Final Thoughts

Centralised error handling isn’t just a nice-to-have — it’s a must for any Express.js project that’s meant to scale cleanly and be maintained long-term.

The benefits of managing errors in one place:
- 🧹 Cleaner, more focused controller logic
- 🔁 Consistent error responses across your entire API
- 🔒 Better security by hiding sensitive information in production
- 🪵 A single location for logging and debugging

Whether you're working solo or as part of a team, centralising your error logic sets a solid foundation for building reliable, user-friendly applications.

If you're just starting out with Express, it's one of the easiest upgrades you can make — and one of the most impactful.
